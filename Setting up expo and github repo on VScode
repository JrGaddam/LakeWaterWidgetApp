1. Open VSCode
2. Clone the GitHub Repo in terminal  using “git clone <URL>”
3. Run the command “ brew update && brew install watchman”, since I already created the directory and files and committed to the repo, you can go to step4.

4.  Next “npx expo install expo-dev-client” , make sure you are in the directory called “WaterLevel”, if not navigate to that directory.
